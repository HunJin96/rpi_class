00:00:05,749 --> 00:00:07,980



3
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:10,500
versus when she was asking it to

4
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:10,500

envisioning a paradigm shift this next

10
00:00:23,779 --> 00:00:25,920

operate your phone with your voice

14
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:30,420



15
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:33,180
multitask across apps and complete

16
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:33,180



17
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:35,700
complex actions all with nearly zero

18
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:35,700



19
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:37,860
latency and actions like turning on the

20
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:37,860



21
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:40,800
flashlight opening Gmail or checking

it's a very hard problem within solving

26
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:44,760



27
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:46,770

00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:49,200
realization of this vision is not far

30
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:49,200



31
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:51,780

phones later this year this is the best

36
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:04,080



37
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:06,600
way to get things done you just saw them

38
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:06,600



39
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:09,150
making it much faster but it also has to

40
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:09,150



41
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:11,130
be personal enough to really help you

00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:11,130

00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:13,140



45
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:16,020

you can see the assistant picked recipes

60

61
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:36,000

62
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,000



63
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:37,619
a bourbon chicken recipe because it's

64
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:37,619

00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:40,360



69
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:42,700

in linguistics the process of figuring

112
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:35,290



113
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:37,540

115
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:39,250
called reference resolution and it's

116
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:39,250



117
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:41,709
fundamental to understanding human

00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:25,390



211
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:27,520
two ways in the next few weeks now I'd

212
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:27,520



213
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:29,440
like to show you the future of how we're

214
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:29,440



215
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:32,410
improving our mobile driving experience

216
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:32,410



217
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:35,350
even more introducing the assistance new

218
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,350



219
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:39,090
driving mode just put your phone in the

220
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:39,090



221
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:41,320
car and say hey people let's drive

222
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:41,320



223
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:43,780
driving mode has a thoughtfully designed

224
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:43,780



225
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:46,060
dashboard that brings your most relevant

226
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:46,060



227
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:48,220
activities front and center while you're

228
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:48,220



229
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:51,669
driving and includes suggestions

230
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:51,669



231
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:52,870
personalized for you for example if you

232
00:04:51,659 --> 00:04:52,870



233
00:04:51,669 --> 00:04:54,970
have a dinner reservation on your

234
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:54,970



235
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:58,240
calendar will see a convenient shortcut

236
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,240



237
00:04:54,970 --> 00:05:00,160
to navigate to the restaurant or if you

238
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:00,160



239
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,500
started a podcast at end in the morning

240
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:02,500



241
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:05,080
once you get in your car it'll display a

242
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:05,080



243
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:07,870
shortcut to resume the episode right

244
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:07,870



245
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:08,590
where you left off town also pilots off

246
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:08,590



247
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:11,180
contacts

248
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:11,180



249
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:13,490
I think easier to call them

250
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:13,490



251
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:15,919
and recommendations for other things to

252
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,919



253
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:18,590
listen to that once you're navigating

254
00:05:15,909 --> 00:05:18,590



255
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:21,020
phone calls and music appear in a

256
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:21,020



257
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:23,300
low-profile way so you can get things

258
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:23,300



259
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:28,039
done without leaving your navigation

260
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:28,039



261
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:30,080
screen a google play some jazz sure

262
00:05:28,029 --> 00:05:30,080



263
00:05:28,039 --> 00:05:34,280
check out this jazz music station on

264
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:34,280



265
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:36,680
YouTube music now everything is voiced

266
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:36,680



267
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:38,360
in a game so football comes in the

268
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,360



269
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:40,490
assistant will tell you who's calling

270
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:40,490



271
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:43,639
and ask if you want to answer without

272
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:43,639



273
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:47,919
having to take your eyes off or call for

274
00:05:43,629 --> 00:05:47,919



275
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:50,680
mom do you want to pick it up no thanks

276
00:05:47,909 --> 00:05:50,680



277
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:53,060
thanks for your help with the demo mom

278
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:53,060



279
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:55,479
alright it's the best of all with the

280
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:55,479



281
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:58,280
assistant already on your phone there's

282
00:05:55,469 --> 00:05:58,280



283
00:05:55,479 --> 00:06:01,130
all kinds of tasks whether they are at

284
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:01,130



285
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:05,180
home or on the go but we want to build

286
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,180



287
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:08,090
and even more helpful assistant in order

288
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:08,090



289
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:10,669
to process peachtree we rely on complex

290
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,669



291
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:14,479
algorithms it includes multiple machine

292
00:06:10,659 --> 00:06:14,479



293
00:06:10,669 --> 00:06:18,139
learning models one model Maps incoming

294
00:06:14,469 --> 00:06:18,139



295
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:20,090
sound bites into phonetic units another

296
00:06:18,129 --> 00:06:20,090



297
00:06:18,139 --> 00:06:23,360
one takes and assembles these phonetic

298
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,360



299
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:25,849
units into words and then a third model

300
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:25,849



301
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:28,460
predicts the likelihood of these words

302
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:28,460



303
00:06:25,849 --> 00:06:30,110
in the sequence there are so complex

304
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:30,110



305
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:33,009
that they require 100 gigabytes of

306
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:33,009



307
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:35,509
storage and a network connection

308
00:06:32,999 --> 00:06:35,509



309
00:06:33,009 --> 00:06:37,789
bringing these models to your phone

310
00:06:35,499 --> 00:06:37,789



311
00:06:35,509 --> 00:06:40,310
think of it as putting the power of a

312
00:06:37,779 --> 00:06:40,310



313
00:06:37,789 --> 00:06:41,870
Google Data Center in your pocket it's

314
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,870



315
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:45,229
an incredibly challenging computer

316
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:45,229



317
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:48,169
science problem I'm excited to share we

318
00:06:45,219 --> 00:06:48,169



319
00:06:45,229 --> 00:06:50,599
reached a significant milestone further

320
00:06:48,159 --> 00:06:50,599



321
00:06:48,169 --> 00:06:53,960
advances in deep learning have allowed

322
00:06:50,589 --> 00:06:53,960



323
00:06:50,599 --> 00:06:56,409
us to combine and shrink the hundred

324
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:56,409



325
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:59,630
gigabyte models down to half a gigabyte

326
00:06:56,399 --> 00:06:59,630



327
00:06:56,409 --> 00:07:04,430
small enough to bring it onto mobile

328
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:04,430



329
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:08,270
devices this Sirleaf network latency and

330
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:08,270



331
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:09,199
makes the assistants so much faster so

332
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:09,199



333
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:11,509
fast

334
00:07:09,189 --> 00:07:11,509



335
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:14,599
that happened to use your phone would

336
00:07:11,499 --> 00:07:14,599



337
00:07:11,509 --> 00:07:16,490
see slow I think this is going to

338
00:07:14,589 --> 00:07:16,490



339
00:07:14,599 --> 00:07:19,819
transform the future of the assistant

340
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:19,819



341
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:21,889
and I'm thrilled to bring Scott to tell

342
00:07:19,809 --> 00:07:21,889



343
00:07:19,819 --> 00:07:34,279
you more about our next generation

344
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:34,279



345
00:07:21,889 --> 00:07:37,129
assistant what if we could bring the AI

346
00:07:34,269 --> 00:07:37,129



347
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:40,069
that powers the assistant right on your

348
00:07:37,119 --> 00:07:40,069



349
00:07:37,129 --> 00:07:42,620
phone what if the assistant was so fast

350
00:07:40,059 --> 00:07:42,620



351
00:07:40,069 --> 00:07:46,279
at processing your voice that tapping

352
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:46,279



353
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:48,289
operator phone would almost seem slow it

354
00:07:46,269 --> 00:07:48,289



355
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:51,469
opens up many of you spaces and we want

356
00:07:48,279 --> 00:07:51,469



357
00:07:48,289 --> 00:07:52,939
to show you how fast it is internally

358
00:07:51,459 --> 00:07:52,939



359
00:07:51,469 --> 00:07:55,669
we've been calling this the

360
00:07:52,929 --> 00:07:55,669



361
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:58,249
next-generation assistant running on

362
00:07:55,659 --> 00:07:58,249



363
00:07:55,669 --> 00:08:01,129
device it can process an understand

364
00:07:58,239 --> 00:08:01,129



365
00:07:58,249 --> 00:08:04,789

00:08:01,119 --> 00:08:04,789



367
00:08:01,129 --> 00:08:06,979
answers up to ten times faster now make

368
00:08:04,779 --> 00:08:06,979



369
00:08:04,789 --> 00:08:09,050
ease here and she's gonna help us test

370
00:08:06,969 --> 00:08:09,050



371
00:08:06,979 --> 00:08:12,259

372
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:12,259



373
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:12,770
commands to demonstrate its speed on

374
00:08:12,249 --> 00:08:12,770



375
00:08:12,259 --> 00:08:15,050

set a timer for 10 minutes what's the

386
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:42,599



387
00:08:37,289 --> 00:08:47,250

drive it to my hotel

392
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:52,820



393
00:08:52,830 --> 00:09:11,430
turn the flashlight on turn it off take

394
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:11,430



395
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:11,430
a selfie alright now as you can see

396
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:16,860



397
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:21,830
and now the gatehouse instantly now you

398
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,830



399
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:24,170
met a person to notice that with

400
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:24,170



401
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:26,300
continued conversation she was able to

402
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,300



403
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:30,080
make several requests in a row without

404
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:30,080



405
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:31,400
having to say hey evil each time now we

406
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:31,400



407
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,529
all have an effortless way to operate

408
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:33,529



409
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:36,140
your phone you can start to imagine how

410
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:36,140



411
00:09:33,529 --> 00:09:39,560
the assistant used into the device could

412
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:39,560



413
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:41,150
orchestrate pass across apps let's look

414
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:41,150



415
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:43,550
