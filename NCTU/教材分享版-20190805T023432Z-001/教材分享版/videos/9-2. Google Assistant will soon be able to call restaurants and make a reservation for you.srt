turns out a big part of getting things

6
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:11,700



7
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:14,070

00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:15,540
want to get an oil change schedule maybe

10
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:15,540



11
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:18,380

20
00:00:26,509 --> 00:00:29,429



21
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:33,420
way businesses actually rely a lot on

00:00:29,419 --> 00:00:33,420



23
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:35,850
